As part of an industry-sponsored capstone project, our objective was to determine the optimum placement of pin joints in a loader linkage mechanism to minimize material spillage during operation, without affecting the transmission ratio or bucket travel. 

We began by performing a comprehensive parametric analysis in MSC ADAMS, followed by a detailed kinematic study. To identify the best possible pin joint locations, the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm was employed for optimization. 

Once the optimal positions were determined, fatigue analysis was conducted in ANSYS to validate the structural integrity of the modified design under operating loads. Notably, by adjusting the position of pin joint E by less than 13%, we achieved a significant 73.16% improvement in the parallel lifting characteristic of the mechanism, all while preserving the original transmission ratio and range of bucket motion.
